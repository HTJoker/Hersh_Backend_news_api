To successfully use this repo you must create your own .env files as they will not be included by default
the files you need to create would be => .env.test and .env.development
Also use the .env-example file to confirm the format of connecting to the correct database

- I would first recommend to use npm install to download the necessary packages to begin using the repo
- To create the databases you can run the script 'npm run setup-dbs'
- To get data into the database use the script 'npm run seed' to create the tables and store the data in their necessary spaces
